            <p>
                Although some pharmacy informatics teams at Cerner client sites
                may have access to create Cerner Command Language (CCL) queries,
                they may not have full access to compile code, which limits
                their ability to manipulate data that is extracted out of their
                system.
            </p>
            <p>
                These report utilities attempt to bridge the gap between CCL
                ad-hoc queries and the features of compilation that may be
                closed off. This can include regex, pivot tables, advanced
                groupings, etc.
            </p>
